Description: metagenomeSeq is designed to determine features (be it
    Operational Taxanomic Unit (OTU), species, etc.) that are
    differentially abundant between two or more groups of multiple
    samples. metagenomeSeq is designed to address the effects of
    both normalization and under-sampling of microbial communities
    on disease association detection and the testing of feature
    correlations.
