\title{Create a MRexperiment object}
\usage{
newMRexperiment(counts, phenoData = NULL, featureData = NULL,
  libSize = NULL, normFactors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A matrix or data frame of count data. The count data is
representative of the number of reads annotated for a feature (be it gene,
OTU, species, etc). Rows should correspond to features and columns to
samples.}

\item{phenoData}{An AnnotatedDataFrame with pertinent sample information.}

\item{featureData}{An AnnotatedDataFrame with pertinent feature information.}

\item{libSize}{libSize, library size, is the total number of reads for a
particular sample.}

\item{normFactors}{normFactors, the normalization factors used in either the
model or as scaling factors of sample counts for each particular sample.}
}
\value{
an object of class MRexperiment
}
\description{
This function creates a MRexperiment object from a matrix or data frame of
count data.
}
\details{
See \code{\link{MRexperiment-class}} and \code{eSet} (from the Biobase
package) for the meaning of the various slots.

\examples{

cnts = matrix(abs(rnorm(1000)),nc=10)
obj <- newMRexperiment(cnts)
