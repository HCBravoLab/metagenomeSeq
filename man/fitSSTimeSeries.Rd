A list of objects including:
\itemize{
 \item{timeIntervals - Matrix of time point intervals of interest, area of differential abundance, and pvalue.}
 \item{data  - Data frame of abundance, class indicator, time, and id input.}

\description{
Calculate time intervals of interest using SS-Anova fitted models.
Fitting is performed uses Smoothing Spline ANOVA (SS-Anova) to find interesting intervals of time. 
Given observations at different time points for two groups, fitSSTimeSeries 
calculates a  function that models the difference in abundance between two 
groups across all time. Using permutations we estimate a null distribution 
of areas for the time intervals of interest and report significant intervals of time.
Use of the function for analyses should cite:
